<h1>Feed Forward Neural Network</h1>
<p>This is a very simple feed forward neural network that uses the relu activation function and gradient descent. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of how neural networks work, as such the program is implemented from scratch in Lua. Lua was chosen specifically because it is minimalistic and so things as simple as reading a csv file had to be made almost from scratch. Although many better frameworks for building models exist this one has the advantage of running very quickly and being easy to use.</p>
<p>Two external libraries included in the repo are required to run the project. The xeus-lua kernel was used to run this jupyter notebook.</p>
<li>"classic.lua Library": https://github.com/rxi/classic</li>
<li>"DataFrame.lua Library": Work in progress by myself, alpha version included here.</li>
<li>"feedforward.lua Library": This is a .lua version of the project so it can be used elsewhere.</li>

<p>The project is demonstrated here to be working, however, a more detailed analysis on performance is out of the scope of the project currently. I plan on coming back to it at a later point.</p>
